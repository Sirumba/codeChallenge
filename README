## Challenge 1: Student Grade

## Description 
This is a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.


# Project Setup
-to run the program got to the given repository, in the link
-copy the git ssh link 
-choose the repo where you want to clone into and run:
'git clone git@github.com:Sirumba/codeChallenge.git'
using the terminal
-to run the program, run the code in the website.
-There will be a table where you can input the value and click on the button.
-You can input the number in the box to get the grade. 
-Each value can be tested to ascertain that it works. 
-The program only accepts numerical values. 
-If the input section is not filled with any value the program prompts the user to input value. 
-Only values ranging from 0 to 100 will be accepted. Values below or above the range will not be accepted also by the program.







## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

## Description
This is a program that takes as input the speed of a car. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

# Project Setup
- to run the program got to the given repository, 
- To use this repo on your machine requires some simple steps
in the link
- open the terminal
- copy the git ssh link 
- choose the repo where you want to clone into and run:
git clone git@github.com:Sirumba/codeChallenge.git
- to run the program, run the code in the website.
- There will be a table where you can input the value and click on the button. 
- This will allow you to test whether the program performs the needed functionality. That is, input the values and check the points as the output
- Each value can be tested to ascertain that it works. 
To ensure the program runs smoothly it was important to ensure that:
 - The program only accepts numerical values. If the input section is not filled with any value the program prompts the user to input value. 
 - Only values ranging from 1 to 240 will be accepted. Values below or above the range will not be accepted also by the program.
- The codes have been explained in the comment section with step by step description of the various sections of the code. 


## Title : Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

# Description
This is a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.

# Project Setup 
- to run the program go to the given repository, 
- To use this repo on your machine requires some simple steps
in the link
- open the terminal
- copy the git ssh link 
- choose the repo where you want to clone into and run:
'git clone git@github.com:Sirumba/codeChallenge.git'
- to run the program, run the code in the website.
- There will be a table where you can input the value and click on the button. 
- This will allow you to test whether the program performs the needed functionality. That is,the input values will check the NET SALARY value given the amount of the gross salary that will be entered. 
- Each value can be tested to ascertain that it works. 
To ensure the program runs smoothly it was important to ensure that:
 - The program only accepts numerical values. If the input section is not filled with any value the program prompts the user to input value. 
 - 
- The codes have been explained in the comment section with step by step description of the various sections of the code.
